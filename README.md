# workout-timer-react-hooks
Create a list of workouts/tasks that have an assigned time for each task.
User will be prompted to create a task and enter in how long this task should last.
Once you enter in all your tasks in a list, you'll hit the start button. 
Try to finish each task with the time limit you gave it!
Once the timer for an individual task gets to zero, the next task will automatically display and start counting down.

Yes, essentially its a glorified self completing to-do list.
Inspiration came by doing circuit workouts and I noticed there was no good way on my phone to notify me when to switch to the next workout.
Hope this helps all your at home workouts :]
